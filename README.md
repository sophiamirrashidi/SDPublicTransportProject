### Sandy Toes: SDTS San Diego Transit Simulation

Welcome to our 2023 Data Science Project! We redistributed the departures from every bus stop in the University Heights/North Park area of San Diego. The goal (and result) of this redistribution is to schedule more frequent arrivals/departures in bus stops in low income areas and high population areas. This is an inherently more effecient use of public transportation. Using simmulated annealing, we were able to determine a new route which effeciently adds more departures and arrivals to the stops.
